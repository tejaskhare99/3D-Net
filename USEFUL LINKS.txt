Key Concepts - 
  1. Camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and image formation - how a point from the real world gets projected onto the image plane
  2. Image rectification - it is a process by which you transform your input images to simplify your job later on
  3. Disparity map generation - finding the same points in image pairs and estimating the lateral displacement
  4. Reconstruction - use the disparity values and the camera parameters to reconstruct the original 3d point
